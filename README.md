# Synthetic Heart Disease Prediction (ML + Healthcare)

This project generates a synthetic heart disease dataset inspired by real-world clinical features, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance using scikit-learn.

## Features

- Biologically inspired synthetic data generation (20,000 samples)
- Features include age, cholesterol, max heart rate (thalach), thalassemia type, and others
- Generates binary target labels based on a simple risk score with noise
- Trains and evaluates a logistic regression model
- Metrics reported: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC AUC
- Code modularized and ready for further improvement

## Current Results

- Accuracy: ~59%
- ROC AUC: ~0.62
